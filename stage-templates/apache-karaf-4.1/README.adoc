This sub-project creates a *_stage_* where you can test all examples. _A *stage* is a directory with a working install of an OSGi container_, in this case Apache Karaf 4.1. This sub-project builds a full Apache Karaf installation, downloading and unpackaging Karaf inside the `stage` directory. You can rebuild the stage as many times you want.

Once available, *the `stage` will be used as deployment target automatically by all other sub-projects available*. All created Jars will be copied automatically inside `stage/deploy`. If you want to change this, please remove or edit the property file `stage/deploy.properties`.

TIP: You can run Apache Karaf on _Raspberry Pi_. You just need a compatible JDK. See <<Installing Java on Raspberry Pi>> for instructions to install Azul's Zulu OpenJDK.

=== Description

* Apache Karaf will be downloaded from it's site: https://karaf.apache.org/
* The Karaf install file (usually a .zip) will be cached inside `cache/apache-karaf` directory;
* Any previous `stage` will be *completelly removed*;
* A new `stage` is built, with Apache Karaf unzipped inside it;
* A file `stage/deploy.properties` is created, directing Ant to deploy all Jars into Karaf.

TIP: You can change `deploy.properties` to point to any directory you like, so your bundles can be automatically deployed into another OSGi container elsewhere. Set the directory using: +
`deploy.dir=<the full path you want>`

=== How to Build

* Run `ant build-stage` from the project root;
+
or

* Run `ant` from project root. Will build the stage _and also all subprojects_.

=== Testing

* To start Karaf in shell mode use: `stage/bin/karaf`
* To exit Karaf shell, simply hit: kbd:[Ctrl+D]
* To start Karaf in daemon mode use: `stage/bin/start`
* To stop Karaf daemon use: `stage/bin/stop`
* The Karaf log file is located at: `stage/data/log/karaf.log`

TIP: To access WebConsole navigate to: http://localhost:8181/system/console/.
Both username and password are simply `karaf`.

=== Key Directories

Key directories to be aware of:

* `bin` - the scripts used to control Apache Karaf
* `data` - cache, internal data and temporary files
* `data/log` - main log file `karaf.log` is stored here
* `demos` - demo files that can be safely erased
* `deploy` - auto-deploy directory, drop here any Jar you want to install
* `etc` - ALL configuration files
* `instances` - runtime instances, one default instance preconfigured
* `lib` - boot classpath for Karaf
* `system` - primary Maven repository of Karaf for OSGi bundles

=== Installing Java on Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi have a fully certified OpenJDK distribution available: https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-embedded/[ZuluÂ® Embedded^], built by https://www.azul.com/[Azul Systems^]. You can install it on Raspbian Stretch using:

....
# apt-get install dirmngr
# apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 0x219BD9C9
# echo 'deb http://repos.azulsystems.com/debian stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zulu.list
# apt-get update
# apt-get install zulu-embedded-8
# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_152"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Zulu Embedded 8.25.0.76-linux-aarch32hf) (build 1.8.0_152-b76)
OpenJDK Client VM (Zulu Embedded 8.25.0.76-linux-aarch32hf) (build 25.152-b76, mixed mode, Evaluation)
