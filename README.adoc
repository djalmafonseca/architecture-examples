This is the source code for the architectural examples cited on https://github.com/neoautus/lucidj-docs/blob/master/docs/README.adoc[LucidJ Documentation].

Every subdirectory have it's own `build.xml` and can be built independently.

== Prerequisites for Building

* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

== Building the Examples

By default, Ant will download and cache all needed tools, then invoke the `build-all` target. The output of all builds will be located in `dist` directory.

For details on building the code, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available versions;
* `ant clean`: removes the `build` and `dist` directories;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools.

== Key Directories

Key directories to be aware of:

* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars for the custom tasks and other tools
* `dist` - the generated artifacts, where:

== Installing Java on Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi have a fully certified OpenJDK distribution available: https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-embedded/[ZuluÂ® Embedded^], built by https://www.azul.com/[Azul Systems^]. You can install it on Raspbian Stretch using:

....
# apt-get install dirmngr
# apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 0x219BD9C9
# echo 'deb http://repos.azulsystems.com/debian stable main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zulu.list
# apt-get update
# apt-get install zulu-embedded-8
# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_152"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Zulu Embedded 8.25.0.76-linux-aarch32hf) (build 1.8.0_152-b76)
