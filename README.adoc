This is the source code for the architectural examples cited on https://github.com/neoautus/lucidj-docs/blob/master/docs/README.adoc[LucidJ Documentation].

Every subdirectory have it's own `build.xml` and can be built independently.

== Prerequisites for Building

* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

== Building the Examples

By default, Ant will download and cache all needed tools, then invoke the `build-all` target. The output of all builds will be located in `dist` directory.

For details on building the documentation, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available versions;
* `ant clean`: removes the `dist` directory;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools.

== Key Directories

Key directories to be aware of:

* `cache` - stores the downloaded jars for the custom tasks and other tools
* `dist` - the generated artifacts, where:
